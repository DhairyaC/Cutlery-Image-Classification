## Overview

## Goal

## Objectives
1. Take 100 images per class with at least 3 classes using my phone/camera. Display 5 examples from each class.
2. Split the images into a training set, a validation set, and a test set.
3. Build the input pipeline, including the appropriate preprocessing operations, and add data augmentation.
4. Fine-tune a pretrained Xception model on this dataset (the one I created in part 3). Report classification accuracy and give a few examples of correct/incorrect classification (show a few images that were correctly/incorrectly classified).
5. Train a deep neural network from scratch (without pretraining) that contains convolutional layers on this dataset (the one I created in part 3). Report classification accuracy and give a few examples of correct/incorrect classification (show a few images that were correctly/incorrectly classified).
